<!-- HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets -- These are called as HTML elements.
	Elements are made up of two tags: opening tag and closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it)
	Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between it's opening and closing tags.
	often "tags" and "Elements" are used interchangeably. However Element comprises of opening tag, closing tag and any content
	between them.
